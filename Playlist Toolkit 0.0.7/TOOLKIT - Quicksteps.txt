Each folder is set up to attempt to simplify your learning experiencing with coding XML playlists.

Follow each folder if you wish.  Videos will be uploaded throughout the week.

This entire project is forkable via Github if you wish.  It is the best way to get updates to the toolkit.

Add this entire folder to your file manager, and add the files as you go as local playlists.  When you are done with them, you can remove them.

Happy playlisting!
