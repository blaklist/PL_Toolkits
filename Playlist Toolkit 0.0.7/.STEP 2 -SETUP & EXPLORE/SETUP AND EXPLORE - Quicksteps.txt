PLEASE FOLLOW THE VIDEOS IF YOU YOU HAVE TROUBLES

These folders should be in XBMC file manager if you followed TOOLKIT - Quicksteps.txt.

Open your text-editor of choice.  (Notepad++, Textwrangler, Notepad, etc)

MULTITASKING TIP - Minimize XBMC with the \ key on your keyboard and resize the window to a comfortable size.  This is so you can bounce back and forth quickly between your text editor and XBMC.

Explore the files in this folder in iSTREAM as local playlists AND in your text editor to see how they are made.

When you are finished, proceed to the next section in the toolkit!
